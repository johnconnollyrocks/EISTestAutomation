Field metadata elements contain metadata about the page fields on a page, and are defined in Page
	metadata files.


------------------------


Format:
	fieldName	=type##locator(s)##[isRequired]##[messageLocator(s)]
	
	fieldName is a user-defined value, and is used as a reference in Page metadata files and test code
		
These Field metadata properties are required:
	1) type
		
		Must be a value of the ITConstants.FieldType enumeration
		If it is equal to ITConstants.FieldType.READ_ONLY, the field will be interpreted as a field
			used primarily for verifying expected results, and will be skipped by all methods that
			populate the GUI

	2) locator(s)
		
		Defines the Selenium locator(s) for a field
		To specify more than one locator, delimit them with ITConstants.PROPERTY_INSTANCE_DELIM
		Note that a locator can contain a ParameterizedLocatorType object and associated strings,
			instead of a Selenium locator (see documentation in ITConstants.java)
		Note that a locator can contain one or more tokens (see ITConstants.TOKEN_REGEX_TERM
			for details).  These tokens are replaced with relevant data by the test code; the
			resulting locator may then be used to locate a context-specific element in the GUI,
			for example a login link for a specific user in a table of users
  	
These Field metadata properties are optional:
	1) isRequired
	
		If it is specified, it must be a value of the ITConstants.isRequired enumeration:
    		REQUIRED:  expected to be present, and required
    		OPTIONAL:  expected to be present, but not necessarily required
    		VARIABLE:  not expected to be present.  If it turns out to be present, we will populate it;
				if it turns out to be absent, we will skip it and display a warning
		Default is ITConstants.IsRequired.OPTIONAL

	2) messageLocator(s)
	
		Defines the Selenium locator(s) for a field-level error or message field
		To specify more than one messageLocator, delimit them with ITConstants.PROPERTY_INSTANCE_DELIM
		Note that a messageLocator can contain a ParmSet object instead of a Selenium locator
			(see documentation in ITConstants.java); if a ParmSet is present, all other messageLocators
			will be ignored
