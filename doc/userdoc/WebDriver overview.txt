WebDriver overview
  
   WebDriver-Backed Selenium-RC version
		http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#webdriver-backed-selenium-rc
	
	The Java version of WebDriver provides an implementation of the Selenium-RC API.  This means
	that you can use the underlying WebDriver technology using the	Selenium-RC API. This is
	primarily provided for backward compatibility. It allows those who have existing test suites
	using the Selenium-RC API to use WebDriver under the covers. It’s provided to help ease the
	migration path to Selenium-WebDriver. Also, this allows one to use both APIs, side-by-side,
	in the same test code.
	
	Note that WebDriver-backed Selenium requires the Selenium server jar (currently selenium-server-standalone-2.17.0.jar)
	
	Pros
		•Allows for the WebDriver and Selenium APIs to live side-by-side (e.g., can embed Selenese)
		•Provides a simple mechanism for a managed migration from the Selenium RC API to WebDriver’s
		•Does not require the stand-alone Selenium RC server to be run
		•Provides access to Selenium functionality that is not yet implemented in WebDriver
	
	Cons
		•Does not implement every Selenium method
		•More advanced Selenium usage (using “browserbot” or other built-in JavaScript methods from Selenium Core) may not work
		•Some methods may be slower due to underlying implementation differences
