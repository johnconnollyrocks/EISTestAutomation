A window metadata file (also known as a window properties file) contains metadata about a window.
	The contents of the file are used in the instantiation of a Window object.
  
Window metadata files are stored in an application-specific directory, the path of which is built in
	an application-specific constants or "test base" class.  In that directory is a manifest file,
	which contains file handles and actual file names.  The names of all Window metadata files
	MUST be present in the manifest!  (See the AppstoreTestBase class, and documentation in the
	IT Quality Engineering portal for details.) 


------------------------


This Window metadata property is required:
	1) windowName		=myWindowName

		Used in page metadata files and Page object methods as a means of determining the window to
			which the page belongs

These Window metadata properties are optional:
	1) locator			=myLocator

		Defines the Selenium locator for a window
		If a locator is not supplied, or is specified as "main", the window will be assumed to
			be the application's main window
		There cannot be more than one (unlike locators and messageLocators in page and field metadata)
		Note that the locator may not contain a ParmSet object instead of a string
		NOTE that this field has been deprecated since the migration to WebDriver 
		
	2) loadTimeout		=timeoutInMillis
	
		Used when waiting for a child Page of the window to load
		Defaults to the value in ITConstants.DEFAULT_WINDOW_WAIT_TIMEOUT
		Specify in millisecondspageRedrawDelay
		
	3) pageRedrawDelay	=delayInMillis
	
		Used when waiting for a child Page of the window to be redrawn (ala Ajax)
		Defaults to the value in ITConstants.DEFAULT_PAGE_REDRAW_DELAY
		Specify in milliseconds
